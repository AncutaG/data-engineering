### Recommendation engines

The customer’s past behavior or the series of the product characteristics are under consideration. Besides, various types of data such as demographic data, usefulness, preferences, needs, previous shopping experience, etc. go via the past data learning algorithm.

### UX automation

 - auto-complete,
 - auto-suggest,
 - auto-compare,
 - auto-search,
 - auto-navigate

Auto-complete, the first generation assistant, simply uses the reverse index (aka word list) to look up words matching the characters the user has entered so far. The most relevant suggestions are identified using frequency information from the word list.

Auto-Suggest:Simply looking up words starting with the same letters soon was not good enough anymore. Users wanted to have real suggestions, even if they didn’t know the exact spelling – or would you know how to spell José Manuel Barroso’s last name correctly?
