# Data Engineering

How would you bootstrap a Data Team? Here below a "laundry list" of tasks, resources, job profiles, and blueprints on how to build a dream data team. Mission: manage all the data, learn from it, and deliver concrete and tangible business results to the rest of the organization.

## Team

Profiles share both a Dev and Production Load.
 - 1x [Infra](profiles/infra.md) (Metal, Physical, Metal as a service, IaaS)
 - 1x [DevOps](profiles/devops.md) (Stack automation,, Containers and Platform as a service)
 - 2x [Data Engineer](profiles/data.md) (Data Pipelines, Hadoop and Kubernetes services, Data Automation, Data as a Service)
 - 3x [Analytics](profiles/analytics.md) (1x Ingestion, 1x Analytics, 1x Real-Time Apps)

## Principles

 - Python is the default language for all the data stack.
 - Engineers over Scientists
 - Convention over Configuration over Coding.
 - Re-use over Integrate over Build.
 - Service Oriented (CLI, Web HTTP APIs , Python Libraries)

## Resources
 - [data resources](resources.md)
